Dear Manager, Software Adoption,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Adoption Specialist TSC Coordinator position at the University of Denver. With an extensive background in quality assurance, systems administration, and technical support, I am enthusiastic about leveraging my decade-long experience to enhance the university’s technology landscape.

In my current role as a QA Technician at Barn Owl Tech, I have been pivotal in enhancing product development and testing processes, particularly through implementing Linux-based solutions and automated SaaS platform testing. This expertise is directly applicable to facilitating the effective adoption and technical support of software at the University's Technology Solution Center.

What draws me to this position is the prospect of marrying my technical skills with the university’s mission of fostering a cutting-edge educational environment. My proficiency in training and supporting users makes me a suitable candidate to champion the IT services offered at DU and to drive engagement with the university's diverse suite of technology offerings.

I am keen to discuss how my experience can support the Information Technology/Enterprise Application Services at the University of Denver in promoting a robust educational technology framework.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the University's esteemed commitment to technology and education.

Warm regards,

Alex Curtis
